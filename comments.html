<p>I am really curious what the future of Ham radio looks like. I have several times in my life tried to explore this hobby but mostly was turned off from it by the fact that it didn’t seem to offer much compared to what I could do on the internet aside from using public spectrum. Don’t get me wrong, I think it is cool and I see the use case for emergency response situations. But the idea of the community just never struck the cord with me how other communities have (mostly old white dudes, it seems).
Am I wrong? Is there a place for hams in the world where you can more quickly and reliably reach anyone from anywhere across the internet?</p>
