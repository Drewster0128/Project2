# Team Fantastic Three - Project 2

### ***Members: Amina Karabek, Courtland Divinity Jr., Andrew Cook***

### **Remake of Website:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/](https://news.ycombinator.com/)

## **Screenshots of original Screenshots of original website/pages to be fixed + simple plan of action commentary:**

### First Page: "News"
This page is the main page, and needs an easier read for viewers with a more visually vibrant front page. The title bar is small, and the main website name is almost unreadable. Our group plans to create a news page that will not only capture the attention of viewers with images, but also have an organized system of where to go for a desired page to view. This system will have a clear setup on where to go on the website and where to click.

### Second Page: "Comments"
The second page is clustered the same way as the first page. It needs to have a specific post mentioned and the comments following it, in order to know what different users are saying for points in the article. By focusing on putting the comments to the side and the image/article on the other side, viewers can understand what post they are commenting on and easily scroll through other users comments.

### Third Page: "Submit"
The third page does not even follow the same colored aesthetics of the website, and is bonded to the left side of the screen. Our group plans to change the name of the "Submit" page to a "Sign up" page, and to center the form as well as make it larger and add commentary on top of the form. Our group also plans to make sure it visually matches the aesthetics of the other pages.
